# Customer Service Flow Application

## Project Overview
The Customer Service Flow Application is a web-based platform allowing users to connect with service providers such as plumbers, electricians, cleaners, and more. The application features an interactive map where users can select service providers based on job type, share their location, and get notified when the selected provider is on their way. Additionally, it includes a provider view for service professionals to accept or reject job requests.

## Installation
To get started with the Customer Service Flow Application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repo-link.git
   cd customer-service-flow
   ```

2. **Open `index.html` in a browser**:
   Simply open the HTML files in a modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge) to view the application.

There is no installation of additional packages needed as all dependencies are included via CDN in the HTML files.

## Usage
1. **User Flow**:
   - Open `login.html` to log in as a service provider.
   - Once logged in, you will be redirected to `provider-view.html` where you can see job requests and your current location on the map.
   - Users can interact on `customer-flow.html` to contact providers, share their location, and confirm when the provider is on the way.

2. **Provider Flow**:
   - Providers can accept or reject job requests presented to them when they receive notifications.

## Features
- Interactive map utilizing Leaflet.js to show user and provider locations.
- Filtering of service providers based on job type.
